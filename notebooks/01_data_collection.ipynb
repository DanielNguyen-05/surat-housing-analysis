    "## 1. Data Subject & Context\n",
    "*   **Topic:** Residential Real Estate Market.\n",
    "*   **Domain:** Urban Housing & Economics.\n",
    "*   **Context:** This dataset provides a snapshot of the real estate market in **Surat, India**—one of the fastest-growing cities in the world (known as the Diamond City). It contains listings for residential flats, detailing property features, location, physical specifications, and pricing.\n",
    "*   **Significance:** Analyzing this data reflects broader socio-economic patterns, including urban housing demand, the \"price-to-feature\" ratio, and how infrastructure development influences property valuation in rapidly developing economies like India."

    "## 5. Potential Limitations & Biases (Critical Thinking)\n",
    "*Since this is a scraped dataset, we acknowledge the following limitations:*\n",
    "1.  **Selection Bias:** The data only represents properties listed *online* on a specific platform (MagicBricks). It excludes offline transactions or properties listed on competitors' sites, potentially skewing towards a clearer, more tech-savvy demographic.\n",
    "2.  **Asking Price vs. Selling Price:** The `Price` column represents the *asking price* (listing price), which is often higher than the actual *transaction price* (sold price).\n",
    "3.  **Self-Reporting Errors:** Data is entered by agents or owners. Subjective fields like \"Furnishing Status\" or textual descriptions may contain exaggerations or inconsistencies.\n",
    "4.  **Temporal Bias:** As the data is from ~2023 and not updated, it does not reflect current market inflation or recent infrastructure changes in Surat.\n"

    "## 6. Motivation & Research Direction\n",
    "### Why this dataset?\n",
    "Our group consists of 3 members interested in **Economic Data Analysis** and **Data Engineering**. We initially considered datasets from Vietnam (HCMC, Hanoi) or China, but chose this Surat dataset for two main reasons:\n",
    "1.  **Complexity (\"Uncleaned\"):** The dataset is intentionally \"messy\" (units in 'Cr', 'Lac', mixed text in numerical columns), providing an excellent opportunity to demonstrate advanced **Data Cleaning** and **Regex** skills as required by the course.\n",
    "2.  **Scale:** India's housing market shares many similarities with Vietnam (rapid urbanization, density), making the insights potentially relatable.\n"

    "*   **Price Determinants:** Which features (Area, Balconies, Furnishing) correlate most strongly with price?\n",
    "*   **Geospatial Analysis:** Which localities in Surat command the highest \"Price per Sq.ft\"?\n",
    "*   **Predictive Modeling:** Can we build a Regression model to predict listing prices based on physical attributes with high accuracy?"
